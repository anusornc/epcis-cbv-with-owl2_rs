# Leptos Integration Plan

## Current Status
âœ… **Static HTML/CSS/JS Frontend Complete** - Fully functional web interface implemented

## Future Leptos Integration Plan

### Why Leptos Was Not Used Initially
- **Compatibility Issues**: Leptos 0.2 requires nightly Rust features not available on stable Rust
- **Immediate Need**: Static HTML/CSS/JS provides immediate functionality without compatibility constraints
- **Production Ready**: Current solution is stable and works with existing Rust ecosystem

### Future Integration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Rust Version Upgrade**
   - Move to nightly Rust channel when Leptos stabilizes
   - Ensure all dependencies are compatible with nightly features

2. **Leptos Version Assessment**
   - Monitor Leptos development for stable release
   - Evaluate Leptos 0.3+ when available for stable Rust support

#### Phase 2: Architecture Planning
1. **Component Migration Strategy**
   - Identify reusable components from current HTML/CSS/JS
   - Plan Leptos component structure
   - Design state management approach

2. **API Integration**
   - Maintain existing REST API endpoints
   - Create Leptos-specific API client
   - Ensure backward compatibility

#### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Incremental Migration**
   - Start with simple components (Navigation, Metrics)
   - Gradually migrate complex components (Query Interface, Dashboard)
   - Maintain parallel static HTML during transition

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement server-side rendering with Leptos
   - Optimize WASM bundle size
   - Ensure performance matches or exceeds current solution

#### Phase 4: Production Deployment
1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Comprehensive testing of Leptos components
   - Performance benchmarking against current solution
   - User acceptance testing

2. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Canary deployment alongside existing frontend
   - Gradual rollout based on stability metrics
   - Final cutover when Leptos version is proven stable

### Benefits of Future Leptos Integration
- **Type Safety**: Full stack type safety with Rust
- **Performance**: Optimized WASM compilation
- **Developer Experience**: Single language full-stack development
- **Ecosystem**: Integration with existing Rust ecosystem

### Timeline Considerations
- **Wait for Leptos Stability**: Monitor for stable Rust support
- **Community Adoption**: Wait for broader community adoption and documentation
- **Production Readiness**: Ensure Leptos is production-ready before migration

### Current Solution Advantages
- **Stability**: Works with stable Rust
- **Performance**: Fast loading and execution
- **Maintainability**: Standard web technologies
- **Compatibility**: Works across all browsers without WASM requirements

## Recommendation
Continue with current static HTML/CSS/JS solution until Leptos achieves stable Rust support and broader production adoption. The current solution provides all required functionality with excellent performance and maintainability.
